        <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <h3>For The Marinade</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the yogurt, ginger, garlic, spices, salt and pepper until combined.</li>
                <li>Add the chicken and mix together until every piece of chicken is completely coated. You can use this right away or refrigerate for up to overnight for added flavor.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>For The Tikka Masala</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Heat a high sided saute pan to medium high, and grease with cooking spray. Once the pan is hot, add all the chicken cubes and sear, without touching for 2 minutes, or until golden brown on the first side. Flip each piece, and sear for 1 more minute. Remove the chicken from the pan and set aside, the chicken will still be raw in the center at this point, so no tasting!</li>
                <li>Lower the heat to medium and add the onion and season lightly with salt. Stir to combine and then add in the garlic and ginger. Saute for 3 minutes or until the onion has softened.</li>
                <li>Add the spices and stir to combine with the onions, Saute for 30 seconds or until fragrant.</li>
                <li>Stir in the chicken stock, grushed tomatoes, and a splash of water. Season lightly with salt to taste. Increase the heat to medium high, and bring to a boil. Once it starts to boil, add the mixture to a blender and blend on high until it is as smooth as possible.</li>
                <li>Return the blended mixture to the pan and add a splash of water to thin the sauce out slightly. Reduce heat to low and bring the mixure to a simmer. Add the chicken back to the pan, and let simmer for 10 minutes, or until the chicken is completely cooked through and the sauce has reduced.</li>
                <li>Add half and half, stir, and simmer for 3 more minutes.</li>
                <li>Season to taste with salt, and serve immediately with 1 cup of rice per plate and garnish with cilantro leaves.</li>
            </ol>
